# RSA-Example
This is a very small implementation of RSA algorithm in python. This program is just for learning purpose. 

keygen.py -- Public and private key generator.
enc&dec.py -- Message Encrypter and Decrypter.

Public and private key are generated in the form (n,e) and (n,d) respectively. 
n is also referred as the "common integer" in this program.

This program is written in Python 2.
